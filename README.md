# Healthy food

### This site is my pet project about healthy food and diet selection. Which I developed while taking a course on native Javascript. Ð¡ode is divided into modules and assembled with webpack. I will briefly describe each:

___

###### calc - Calorie calculator takes into account your gender, body parameters, and activity and calculates the number of calories you need. Selected options are saved in local storage
###### modal - Modal window with contact form. Opens 30 seconds after entering the site (the parameter is changed for the convenience of viewing the site for 30 minutes) it also opens if you scroll the site to the very bottom and actually when you click on the communication buttons
###### slider - Carousel slider with position counter
###### cards - Cards with diet menus and prices (which are converted to UAH) and descriptions for them. Cards are loaded from a file db.json
###### timer - Time counter until the end of the promotion (Actually at the moment before the start of my birthday)
###### forms - Modal window forms
###### tabs - Menu with cards and content description
